              <h3>Siblings holding hands</h3>
              <p>
                Had a request to take an old photo of two young siblings the last time they were together at their home in Peru. The family wanted an art piece to be kept on display to preserve the integrity of the photo. The chosen method was stipling, which instead of traditional pen strokes, it involves creating a series of dots of various sizes in order to create the image.<br />

            <h3>INTRO</h3>
            <p>
              My name is Denny and I spent about six years working as a graphic designer for an in-house creative department while pursuing my passion for painting on the side and actually making the occasional sale! After doing make-up for friends, family and the friends of friends and family, I decided to quit the corporate rat race and focus on my art. One night on a dare, I took the last spot at an open mic comedy night and have been telling jokes ever since. I'll keep tellin' em as long as they keep laughing.
            </p>

              "It is impossible for you to be angry and laugh at the same time. Anger and laughter are mutually exclusive and you have the power to choose either." ~ Wayne Dyer

            <p>
              I received my BFA at the Savannah College of Art and Design with complementary studies in photography, screen printing, painting and a touch of web related design. SCAD was the PERFECT place to explore any and every creative dream you might have. I absolutely loved my time there!
